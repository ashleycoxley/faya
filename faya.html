				<p>Fancy, athletic Dutch mare with beautiful movement and a powerful jump. Faya has been shown with good success through 1st level dressage and .95m jumpers. She is sensitive and can get strong, so requires a tactful, brave rider. She'd make a fantastic partner for a professional or other experienced rider who can offer her a consistent program.</p>

				<p>Faya is relatively green in the jumper ring but shows great promise, winning 2 classes in her first outing in the .85m and .95m classes at JK Presents (hosted at Woodside). She has more experience showing in dressage, with strong scores at USDF shows at First Level all around Northern California with her previous ownder. She’s great for the farrier, clips and bathes, ships like a champ, and is good to handle on the ground.</p>

				<p>I’m selling her because while I love riding her, she’s ultimately too much horse for me. With the right rider, she’s capable of amazing things! Contact me for more information and to try her at <a href="mailto:fayadutchwarmblood@gmail.com">fayadutchwarmblood@gmail.com</a></p>
